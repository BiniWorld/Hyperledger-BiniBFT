# Hyperledger BiniBFT

The goal of this project is to develop BiniBFT, a powerful and robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus library for Hyperledger Fabric. The primary objective is to enhance the capabilities of Hyperledger Fabric, making it more suitable for a wide range of distributed and decentralized day-to-day applications. BiniBFT aims to achieve this by providing end-to-end security, high throughput with low latency, and exceptional scalability.
